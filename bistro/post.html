<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching</q>.</p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2012-10-30" pubdate>November 30.</p>
